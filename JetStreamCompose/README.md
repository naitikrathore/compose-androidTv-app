## Performance

### Benchmarks

The `benchmarks` module contains sample tests written using [`Macrobenchmark`](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/macrobenchmark) library. It also contains the test to generate the baseline profile for JetStream app.

### Baseline profiles

The baseline profile for this app is located at [`jetstream/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`](jetstream/src/main/baseline-prof.txt). It contains rules that enable AOT compilation of the critical user path taken during app launch. To learn more about baseline profiles, read [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/baselineprofiles).

For more details on how to generate & apply baseline profiles, check [this document](baseline-profiles.md).
